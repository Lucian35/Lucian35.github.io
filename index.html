    <p>It's not ready yet. You should not be here.</p>
    
    <a href="test_page.html">Link to another page (For testing purposes)</a>
    
    <p>In the meantime here are some fun websites to check out:</p>
    <p>Be wary of "download" or "Start" buttons because there are a lot of ads that try to disguise themselves as part of the website.</p>
    
    <a href="https://neal.fun/">Neal's Website</a>
    <a href="https://orteil.dashnet.org/">Orteil's Website</a>
    <a href="https://willyoupressthebutton.com/">Will You Press The Button?</a>
    <a href="https://theuselessweb.com/">The Useless Web.</a>
    <a href="http://www.xgenstudios.com/">XGen Studios</a>
    
    <p>XGen has made some fun web games but I haven't been able to get them to work, so you might have to jump through some hoops or play them on other websites. I especially recomend the <i>Stick RPG</i> series and <i>Defend Your Castle</i>.</p>
